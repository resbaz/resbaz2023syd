  title: Introduction to Cheminformatics in Python
  description: "This workshop will be an interactive demonstration in which you will be introduced to the use of Python for cheminformatic modelling using Google Co-lab notebooks. The session also demonstrates the utility of cloud computing for educational purposes negating the need for students to setup complicated infrastructure before getting down to the learning part of their activities. Participants will access an online data source via a Google Colab Jupyter Notebook and generate fingerprint representations of chemical data for subsequent modelling in SciKitLearn. The final model will be predictive of psychedelic activity based on the structure-activity relationship found in a set of phenethylamine molecules."

- description: A hands-on workshop giving a brief history of the last few months of development of "Generative AI." These tools, these Large Language Models, offer present promise and peril -- disruption -- to ways of working and of learning. Outside the "hype," these tools are "calculators for words" and allow the same manipulation and reflection of a user's words as a calculator offers for a user's numbers. The workshop will guide users into using various free and paid tools, and the effective use of Large Language Models through chain of thought prompting. Remember: a LLM is "Always confident and usually correct."

- description: This presentation delves into an innovative study that establishes
    a standardized approach following accredited clinical genome testing for genetic
    diseases. Our research, centered around 499 individuals with genetic heart ailments
    in Australia, employs advanced bioinformatics analysis and lab-based functional
    assessments. Notably, we identified additional disease-causing variations in 10
    previously undiagnosed participants. The results show that a combination of secondary
    bioinformatics analysis and lab studies can better identify the cause of inherited
    heart diseases, leading to improved diagnoses and better management for affected
    individuals and their family members.

- description: This presentation will explore techniques in Systemic Functional Linguistics
    (SFL), the study of the relationship between language and its social context,
    for analysing qualitative data. In particular,this presentation will address how
    SFL intersects with new advances in generative artificial intelligence and natural
    language processing (NLP). The examples in this presentation relate to social
    media data, covering the collection of social media data, the development of social
    media corpora using corpus linguistic tools, and how manual SFL analyses and automated
    NLP analyses can intersect. The overall aim of this presentation is to introduce
    the audience to SFL and provide a number of resources and tools for researchers
    interested in this particular methodology and its future.

- description: The Data Directory Cataloger is a Python program that helps research groups to catalog their data directories. The entire Python program is less than 500 lines. Researchers just drop a README text file containing a few metadata fields into directories containing their data. The Python program scans directories for those README files. It collates the metadata into Markdown documents. A static website generator then creates a web site from those documents. The UTS is currently using this to help research groups to document their data on our HPC data storage system.
