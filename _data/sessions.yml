  title: Introduction to Cheminformatics in Python
  description: "This workshop will be an interactive demonstration in which you
    will be introduced to the use of Python for cheminformatic modelling using 
    Google Co-lab notebooks. The session also demonstrates the utility of cloud
    computing for educational purposes negating the need for students to setup
    complicated infrastructure before getting down to the learning part of their
    activities. Participants will access an online data source via a Google Colab
    Jupyter Notebook and generate fingerprint representations of chemical data
    for subsequent modelling in SciKitLearn. The final model will be predictive
    of psychedelic activity based on the structure-activity relationship found in
    a set of phenethylamine molecules. Participants will need a Google account to
    be able to make their own cheminformatics models in this workshop."

  title: Getting Started With Your Research Using the Gale Digital Scholar Lab
  description: For researchers, DH scholarship is fueling new ways of
    interrogating content, analysing insights, and outputting discoveries, and is
    fundamentally shifting how scholars partner together to make new types of
    research possible. Collaboration is a key driver of change as people with
    diverse backgrounds and skills come together to address common barriers
    related to applying new computing tools to content that may not always be
    prepped and accessible. Together with libraries, Gale is poised to help
    colleges and universities launch, enhance, or accelerate their digital
    scholarship programs, strengthening connections with faculty and students.
    Gale Digital Scholar Lab, developed with participation from beta testers
    across a wide range of institutions and organisations, is designed to
    transform the way scholars and students access and analyse Gale primary
    source materials by offering solutions to some of the most common challenges
    facing researchers in the digital humanities today. By integrating an
    unmatched depth and breadth of digital primary source matter with the most
    popular DH tools, Gale Digital Scholar Lab provides a new lens to explore
    history and empowers researchers to generate world-altering conclusions and
    outcomes. Through advanced humanities computing tools that make natural
    language processing (NLP) for historical texts accessible, more efficient,
    and impactful, the footprint of digital humanities can be expanded to more
    classrooms around the globe. This session will showcase The Gale Digital
    Scholar Lab, a cloud based text and data mining tool allowing researchers,
    academics and students text and data mine Gale Primary sources and also the
    ability to upload their own content into the Lab for analysis.

  description: "<p>A two-hour hands-on workshop giving a brief history of the last few months of development of \"Generative AI.\" These tools, these Large Language Models, offer present promise and peril -- disruption -- to ways of working and of learning. Outside the \"hype,\" these tools are \"calculators for words\" and allow the same manipulation and reflection of a user's words as a calculator offers for a user's numbers. The workshop will guide users into using various free and paid tools, and the effective use of Large Language Models through chain of thought prompting.</p> <p>Remember: a LLM is \"Always confident and usually correct.\"</p><p>Topics:<br /><ul><li>What are these Generative AI/LLM things? (Activity I: Think, Pair, Share)</li><li>and how should we think about them? (Activity II: Asking a question of a PDF)</li><li>How can we currently use these tools in useful ways? (Activity III: Demonstration of github copilot)</li><li>Dangers and confabulations (Activity IV: Replicating a confabulation)</li> </ul> <p>There will be multiple hands-on activities throughout the workshop, so please bring a fully charged laptop.</p> <p><a href=\"https://osf.io/rd24y/\" target=\"_blank\">The slides for previous workshops are available CC-BY</a></p>"

- description: This presentation delves into an innovative study that establishes
    a standardized approach following accredited clinical genome testing for genetic
    diseases. Our research, centered around 499 individuals with genetic heart ailments
    in Australia, employs advanced bioinformatics analysis and lab-based functional
    assessments. Notably, we identified additional disease-causing variations in 10
    previously undiagnosed participants. The results show that a combination of secondary
    bioinformatics analysis and lab studies can better identify the cause of inherited
    heart diseases, leading to improved diagnoses and better management for affected
    individuals and their family members.

    (SFL), the study of the relationship between language and its social context,
    for analysing qualitative data. In particular,this presentation will address how
    SFL intersects with new advances in generative artificial intelligence and natural
    language processing (NLP). The examples in this presentation relate to social
    media data, covering the collection of social media data, the development of social
    media corpora using corpus linguistic tools, and how manual SFL analyses and automated
    NLP analyses can intersect. The overall aim of this presentation is to introduce
    the audience to SFL and provide a number of resources and tools for researchers
    interested in this particular methodology and its future.

  title: The Data Directory Cataloger - It's Just a Simple Python Program
  description: The Data Directory Cataloger is a Python program that helps
    research groups to catalog their data directories. The entire Python program
    is less than 500 lines. Researchers just drop a README text file containing a
    few metadata fields into directories containing their data. The Python
    program scans directories for those README files. It collates the metadata
    into Markdown documents. A static website generator then creates a web site
    from those documents. The UTS is currently using this to help research groups
    to document their data on our HPC data storage system.
